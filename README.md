# Streamflow-prediction-using-AI-ML-techniques
Streamflow prediction is essential for efficiently managing water resources such as dams and reservoirs. If streamflow can be predicted accurately, then the stable water supply for agriculture and industry from the reservoir can be assured. Also, if there is high streamflow, properly planned actions can be taken, such as opening reservoir gates, alerting people living in low-lying areas, or shifting them if required. This study predicts streamflow in the Yerli sub-catchment of the Purna River, a major tributary of the Tapi River, using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), M5 Model Trees and Random Forest. Python(Scikit-learn library) is used to develop these models, and Jupyter Notebook is used as an Integrated Development Environment for Python.

Time series Model: Considering discharge with different time lag are used as features.
Cause-Effect Model: Considering rainfall and temperature as features.
Combined Model: Considering mixture of both features mentioned above.

80% of data is used for training the machine learning models and 20% is used to test the model.
